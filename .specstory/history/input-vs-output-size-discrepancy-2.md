## Input vs Output Size Discrepancy (2/17/2025, 5:37:43 PM)

_**User**_

why is the output / preview not the same size as the input?

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the code to understand why there might be a size discrepancy between the input and output. I'll look at the relevant sections.

Let me make the text input wider and also ensure the preview area scales appropriately:

```diff
-       <div className="w-full max-w-7xl space-y-4">
+       <div className="w-full max-w-[1600px] space-y-4">
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
            />
            <Sheet>
              <SheetTrigger asChild>
                <Button
                  variant="outline"
                  size="icon"
-                 className="relative h-auto aspect-square"
+                 className="relative h-auto aspect-square flex-shrink-0"
                >
```

I've made these changes:
1. Increased the max-width to 1600px using a custom value
2. Added `w-full` to the textarea to ensure it takes up all available space
3. Added `flex-shrink-0` to the settings button to prevent it from shrinking

This should make the text input area significantly wider while maintaining the proper layout. Let me know if you'd like it even wider!

_**User**_

can we make the text input a bit wider? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll make it even wider by using an even larger custom width and adjusting the layout to maximize the available space.
