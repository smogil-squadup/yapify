I'll help you modify the code to have the "Remove Background" setting enabled by default. I'll need to update the initial state of the `settings` object in the `TextAnimator` component.

Let me make this change:

---

```diff
      colorPalette: "retro" as ColorPalette,
      loops: 2,
-     removeBackground: false,
+     removeBackground: true,
      colorChangeSpeed: 1,
    });
```

I've updated the code to set `removeBackground: true` in the initial settings state. Now when users load the text animator, it will start with a transparent background by default. All other settings remain unchanged.

The change will be immediately visible as:
1. The main background will be transparent instead of blue
2. The "Remove Background" switch in the settings panel will be toggled on by default
3. Any exported GIFs or PNGs will have a transparent background by default unless the user explicitly turns this setting off

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
