_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the code to understand why there might be a size discrepancy between the input and output. I'll look at the relevant sections of the code.

Let me make the text input wider and also adjust the default text size:

---

_****_

```diff
        <div
-         className="w-full max-w-7xl space-y-4"
+         className="w-full max-w-[1536px] space-y-4"
        >
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
            />

  const [settings, setSettings] = useState<AnimationSettings>({
-   size: 2.5,
+   size: 4,
    speed: 1,
    animationStyle: "dropIn" as AnimationStyle,
    colorPalette: "retro" as ColorPalette,
    loops: 2,
    removeBackground: true,
    colorChangeSpeed: 1,
    textStroke: true,
    textPosition: { x: 50, y: 50 },
  });
```

I've made two key changes:
1. Increased the container width to 1536px (the next step up from max-w-7xl)
2. Added `w-full` to the textarea to ensure it takes up all available space
3. Increased the default text size from 2.5 to 4 to make the text more prominent in the preview

The text input should now be significantly wider, and the text in the preview should be larger by default. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust either of these values further!

can we make the text input a bit wider?

_**Assistant**_

I'll make it even wider by using an even larger custom width value.

```diff
        <div
-         className="w-full max-w-[1536px] space-y-4"
+         className="w-full max-w-[2000px] space-y-4 mx-4"
        >
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y flex-1"
            />
```

I've made these changes:
1. Increased the max width to 2000px
2. Added `mx-4` to maintain some margin from the screen edges
3. Changed `w-full` to `flex-1` to ensure the textarea takes up all available space while respecting the flex container

The text input should now be much wider while still maintaining a good layout. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust it further!

I'll make it even wider by using a much larger custom width and adjusting the layout to be more accommodating.

-         className="w-full max-w-[2000px] space-y-4 mx-4"
+         className="w-full max-w-[3000px] space-y-4 mx-4"
        >
-         <div className="flex gap-2">
+         <div className="flex gap-4 items-start">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y flex-1"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-[90%]"
            />
            <Sheet>
              <SheetTrigger asChild>
                <Button
                  variant="outline"
                  size="icon"
+                 className="shrink-0"
                >
```

I've made these changes:
1. Increased the max width to 3000px
2. Changed from `flex-1` to `w-[90%]` to ensure the textarea takes up most of the available space
3. Added `shrink-0` to the settings button to prevent it from shrinking
4. Increased the gap between textarea and button
5. Added `items-start` to align items at the top

The text input should now be significantly wider. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust it further!
