## Input vs Output Size Discrepancy (2/17/2025, 5:37:12 PM)

_**User**_

why is the output / preview not the same size as the input? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the code to understand why there might be a size discrepancy between the input and output. I'll look at the relevant sections that handle sizing.

Let me make the text input wider and also adjust the default text size:

```diff
-       <div className="w-full max-w-7xl space-y-4">
+       <div className="w-full max-w-[1600px] space-y-4">
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
            />

  const [settings, setSettings] = useState<AnimationSettings>({
-   size: 2.5,
+   size: 4,
    speed: 1,
    animationStyle: "dropIn" as AnimationStyle,
    colorPalette: "retro" as ColorPalette,
    loops: 2,
    removeBackground: true,
    colorChangeSpeed: 1,
    textStroke: true,
    textPosition: { x: 50, y: 50 },
  });
```

I've made these changes:
1. Increased the container width to 1600px using a custom max-width
2. Added `w-full` to the textarea to ensure it takes up all available space
3. Increased the default text size from 2.5 to 4

The text input should now be much wider, and the default text size should be larger in the preview. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust these values further!

can we make the text input a bit wider?

_**Assistant**_

I'll make it even wider by using an even larger custom width and ensure it takes up more of the screen space.

```diff
-       <div className="w-full max-w-[1600px] space-y-4">
+       <div className="w-full max-w-[2000px] mx-4 space-y-4">
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <Textarea
              placeholder="ENTER YOUR TEXT..."
              value={text}
              onChange={handleTextChange}
-             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-lg p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
+             className="font-['Press_Start_2P'] text-xl p-6 bg-white/90 min-h-[200px] resize-y w-full"
            />
            <Sheet>
              <SheetTrigger asChild>
                <Button
                  variant="outline"
                  size="icon"
-                 className="relative h-auto aspect-square"
+                 className="relative h-auto aspect-square shrink-0"
                >
```

I've made these changes:
1. Increased the max width to 2000px
2. Added horizontal margin (`mx-4`) to prevent the container from touching the screen edges
3. Made the text input font size larger (`text-xl`)
4. Added `shrink-0` to the settings button to prevent it from being squeezed
5. Ensured the textarea takes up all available width with `w-full`

The text input should now be significantly wider. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust it further!
