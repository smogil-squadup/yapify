## Meme Creation Tool Simplification (2/17/2025, 5:21:48 PM)

_**User**_

maybe I'm not doing a great job of explaining this. 

think of this as a meme creation tool.
the user uploads an image. 
the user adds text.
there is ui where the use can see the added text on top of the image.
the user can decide to download as a gif or png. 

does that make sense / can you update accordingly?

_**Assistant**_

I understand better now - you want to simplify this into a more focused meme creation tool. The current implementation has a lot of extra complexity that isn't needed for this use case. Let me help streamline it.

First, let me search through the code to understand the current image and text handling:

Let me fix the styling to ensure both the image and text are visible:

I've restructured the preview section with proper layering:

1. Created distinct layers for:
   - Background color
   - Image background
   - Interactive text layer
   - Instructions overlay
2. Fixed the image display with proper background properties
3. Ensured all layers are properly positioned with `absolute inset-0`
4. Maintained the text positioning and animation functionality

The image and text should now be visible because:
1. Each layer has proper z-indexing through the order of elements
2. The image uses `contain` to ensure it's fully visible
3. The text layer remains on top of the image
4. All layers are properly positioned within the container

Let me know if you can see both the image and text now! If not, I can try a different approach to the layering.
