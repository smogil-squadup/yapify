the stroke in the output is slightly thicker than it is in the preview

I understand that there's a discrepancy between the stroke thickness in the preview versus the exported output. Let me help fix that by adjusting the text stroke settings to ensure consistency.

The issue is in the `AnimatedLetter` component's text stroke styling. Currently, we're using multiple text shadows to create the stroke effect, which might be rendering differently in the export. Let's modify the stroke settings to be more consistent.

I'll adjust the text stroke and shadow properties:

```diff
          animate={{ color: colorPalettes[settings.colorPalette][colorIndex] }}
          style={{
-           WebkitTextStroke: settings.textStroke ? "1px black" : "none",
+           WebkitTextStroke: settings.textStroke
+             ? `${settings.size * 0.1}rem black`
+             : "none",
            textShadow: settings.textStroke
-             ? `2px 2px 0 #000,
-              -2px -2px 0 #000,
-              2px -2px 0 #000,
-              -2px 2px 0 #000,
-              0 4px 0 #000,
-              0 5px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`
+             ? `${settings.size * 0.05}rem ${settings.size * 0.05}rem 0 #000,
+                -${settings.size * 0.05}rem -${settings.size * 0.05}rem 0 #000,
+                ${settings.size * 0.05}rem -${settings.size * 0.05}rem 0 #000,
+                -${settings.size * 0.05}rem ${settings.size * 0.05}rem 0 #000,
+                0 ${settings.size * 0.1}rem 0 #000`
              : "none",
            fontFamily: "'Press Start 2P', cursive",
```

I've made the following improvements:

1. Made the stroke thickness proportional to the font size using `settings.size * 0.1rem` for `WebkitTextStroke`
2. Made the text shadow offsets proportional to the font size using `settings.size * 0.05rem`
3. Removed the semi-transparent shadow that was causing inconsistency
4. Adjusted the bottom shadow to be proportional to the font size

These changes should make the stroke thickness more consistent between the preview and the exported output because:
1. The stroke thickness now scales with the font size
2. The shadow effects are more precisely controlled and proportional
3. We've removed the semi-transparent shadow that could cause visual differences in the export

Try creating another export with these changes. The stroke thickness should now be more consistent between the preview and the output. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments to the stroke thickness or appearance.
