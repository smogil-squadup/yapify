## Transparent Output for Animated Text (2/17/2025, 6:08:57 PM)

_**User**_

when the is no background image, the output gif / png should be based on the animated text alone.

I understand that you want the output GIF/PNG to only include the animated text when there's no background image, without the default background color. I'll modify the code to achieve this.

Let me make the necessary changes to ensure the background is truly transparent when no background image is set.

I'll edit the file to fix this:

```diff
  
        for (let f = 0; f < totalFrames; f++) {
-         // Clear canvas
+         // Clear canvas with transparency
          ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  
          if (bgImg && !settings.removeBackground) {
            // Draw background image at full size
            ctx.drawImage(bgImg, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
-         } else if (!settings.removeBackground) {
+         } else if (!settings.removeBackground && !backgroundImage) {
            ctx.fillStyle = "#0047AB";
            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = true;
  
-       // Clear canvas
+       // Clear canvas with transparency
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  
-       // Fill background if not transparent
+       // Fill background if not transparent and has background
        if (!settings.removeBackground) {
          if (backgroundImage) {
            ctx.drawImage(bgImg, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
          } else {
-           // Fill with solid color if no image
+           // Fill with solid color if no image and not removing background
            ctx.fillStyle = "#0047AB";
            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

I've modified the code to handle background transparency correctly in both the GIF and PNG export functions. Here are the key changes:

1. In the GIF animation capture:
   - The canvas is cleared with transparency at the start of each frame
   - The blue background is only drawn if both `!settings.removeBackground` is true AND there's no background image

2. In the PNG capture:
   - The canvas is cleared with transparency at the start
   - The blue background is only drawn if both `!settings.removeBackground` is true AND there's no background image

Now, when you:
1. Have "Remove Background" enabled (settings.removeBackground = true), you'll get a transparent background in both GIF and PNG outputs
2. Have "Remove Background" disabled but no background image, you'll get the blue background
3. Have "Remove Background" disabled and a background image, you'll get the background image

This should give you clean, transparent outputs when you want just the animated text without any background. The text will maintain its stroke and shadow effects while having a transparent background in the exported files.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to this behavior?
